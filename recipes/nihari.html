    <h3>Step-wise Directions for making Nihari</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot</li>
        <li>Thinly slice your onion, fry till golden brown then spread on paper towels to dry. (we will use these at the end)</li>
        <li>Add all the remaining ingredients in the first list  and stir fry the meat until its browned and the masala is cooked - about 4-5 minutes</li>
        <li>Then add your Nihari Masala Mix and 7 cups of water and stir well.</li>
        <li>Pressure cook for 45-50 minutes or slow cook for 4-5 hours undisturbed to get beautifully tender meat. For slow cooking stove top, bring the mixture to a boil then let it simmer covered.</li>
        <li>Once the time is up skim any greyish scum that may rise to the top and discard. </li>
        <li>Crush the onions and mix in, bring the nihari to a boil</li>
        <li>If you are serving this another time then set it aside for the nihari to cool.</li>
        <li>When ready to eat then dissolve ⅓ cup atta in 1 cup water and whisk briskly as you add it to the nihari</li>
        <li>The nihari will thicken as it cooks - 10 to 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Adjust consistency per liking (more water or atta+water), just remember you need to simmer after adding it to lose the raw taste.</li>
        <li>Heat a few tbsp of oil in a small saucepan and add 1.5 tbsp of kashmiri laal mirch (for colour) and add it on top of the nihari like a tadka/baghaar. </li>
    </ol>
